I need the current content of the firebase.ts file to make the specific changes. Could you provide the full content of the file, or would you like me to fetch it from the repository first?

Alternatively, if you can share the current content of firebase.ts, I can make the following changes:
- Line 75: Replace `Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9)` with `crypto.randomUUID()`
- Line 121: Replace `Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9)` with `crypto.randomUUID()`
- Fix any other deprecated `substr()` calls by replacing them with `substring()` or `slice()`

Once you provide the file content, I'll make these updates immediately.
